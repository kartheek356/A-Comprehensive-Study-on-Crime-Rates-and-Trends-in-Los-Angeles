# 🚓📊 Los Angeles Crime Analysis – A Data-Driven Approach to Public Safety

Welcome! This project is a comprehensive data science effort to analyze crime trends across **Los Angeles**, leveraging machine learning and statistical modeling to uncover key patterns and provide actionable insights for policymakers, law enforcement, and community leaders.

---

## 🎯 Mission of the Project

The objective is to apply advanced data science techniques to **analyze, model, and predict crime** across different neighborhoods in Los Angeles. The project explores how demographic, temporal, and socioeconomic factors influence crime rates. The end goal is to enable **targeted crime prevention**, smarter policing, and data-informed policy decisions that enhance community safety and well-being.

---

## 🧠 Research Questions

1. What are the **most common types of crimes**, and how do they vary across regions?
2. How does **crime frequency shift over time** in different neighborhoods?
3. Are there **specific days or times** when crimes are more likely to occur?
4. How do **demographic or socioeconomic factors** correlate with crime rates?
5. Can we **identify hotspots**, and do they change over time?
6. Is there a link between **income levels or unemployment** and crime types?
7. Do **residential or commercial zones** attract different crime patterns?
8. Can we **predict future crime trends** using machine learning?
9. How do **different regions compare** in terms of crime rates and risks?
10. Can we assess the **effectiveness of past interventions** using historical data?

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python, SQL
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau (for visualization), GIS (optional)
* **Data Sources**:

  * LAPD Open Crime Dataset
  * Census Bureau (for population/economic data)
  * Geo-spatial data (optional)

---

## 📊 Analytical Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Integration**

   * Combined data from multiple crime and census sources
   * Performed geolocation mapping and date-time parsing

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Identified peak crime hours, locations, and top categories
   * Visualized crime trends across districts and timeframes

3. **Machine Learning Models**

   * Classification of crime types using Random Forest & XGBoost
   * Time series forecasting for crime volume using ARIMA/LSTM
   * Hotspot detection using K-Means or DBSCAN clustering

4. **Evaluation & Insights**

   * Generated crime heatmaps
   * Compared actual vs predicted trends
   * Derived policy recommendations based on model findings

---

## ✅ Key Findings (Expected)

* Crime rates are **not uniformly distributed** and show clear **seasonal and spatial trends**
* **Night hours and weekends** witness more violent crimes
* **Socioeconomic deprivation** correlates with higher theft and assault cases
* Predictive models achieve promising accuracy in **forecasting high-crime periods**
